# Future Development Plans

| Functionality | Button additions |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Message displays instead of alerts. | True/false option. |
| I could do this by using DOM manipulation in my conditional statement | Some questions require a true or false answer, so I would like to implement a function that displays only two options. |
